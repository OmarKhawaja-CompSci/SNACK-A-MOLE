# About Me
This project was created by Omar Khawaja for his ICS4U0 final summative.

# Game Description
A delicious twist on the classic Whack-a-Mole game, Snack-a-Mole is a game where you grab the most snacks you can in 30 seconds. Snacks, each inspired by my peers, appear and disappear. Your only goal is to try to catch them to get the highest score possible.
